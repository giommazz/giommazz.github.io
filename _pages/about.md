I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [IOL Group](https://iol.zib.de/){:target="_blank"} at the Zuse Institute Berlin, where I work with [Sebastian Pokutta](https://www.pokutta.com/){:target="_blank"} among others.  

Previously, I completed a joint PhD in Computer Science at École Polytechnique, France, and Università di Pisa, Italy, mentored by [Claudia D’Ambrosio](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Claudia.D'Ambrosio/){:target="_blank"}, [Antonio Frangioni](https://pages.di.unipi.it/frangio/){:target="_blank"} and [Leo Liberti](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Leo.Liberti/){:target="_blank"}. I hold an MSc in Data Science and Business Informatics from Università di Pisa.  

# Research
My research focuses on convex optimization, with a strong emphasis on first-order methods. Recently I have been working with Frank-Wolfe algorithms for solving convex problems with structured constraints. 
During my PhD, I explored the integration of machine learning predictors into mixed-integer (non)linear problems, and mathematical programming, in particular the distance geometry problem.  

My PhD thesis is [Algorithmic Configuration by Learning and Optimization](https://giommazz.github.io/files/phd_thesis_iommazzo.pdf){:target="_blank"}.  
I was fortunate to receive the "Premio Lorenzo Brunetta", awarded to the best PhD thesis in operations research obtained in the years 2019--2021.
