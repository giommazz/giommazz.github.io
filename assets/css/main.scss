Override any CSS with new CSS styles AFTER the `@import "minimal-mistakes";` line just above.

Anything you place after this point will therefore "cascade and override" the previous CSS styles.

/*
Decrease font sizes of the entire website.
Default values for small, medium, large, and x-large screens are: 16, 18, 20, and 22px. 
All other font sizes are "em" [typography unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_(typography)) multipliers of these pixel (px) values, 
and are therefore relative to and changed by these singular pixel values.
See: https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/1219#issuecomment-326809412
- It looks like the screen pixel sizes to move into each new "size" category are defined in
  the "Breakpoints" section of "_variables.scss"?
